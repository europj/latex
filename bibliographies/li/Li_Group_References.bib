Last Modified: May 5, 2015 by P.J. Lestrange

This bib file uses the "string" command for journal names.  Thus, a list of
strings relating journal abbreviations to either the short journal name or the
full journal name is required for references to be properly formatted.  The
contents of one of two files must be pasted below the line "PLACE JOURNAL
ABBREVIATION..." below: Journal_Short_Name.bib or Journal_Long_Name.bib.  These
files can found at https://github.com/liresearchgroup/latex/tree/master/bibliographies.
